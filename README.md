# event-locations-sample

by Jeff Tabios

This is a sample app made with:
- Visual Studio
- ASP.NET MVC 5
- C#
- JQuery
- Google maps API
- XMLDocument

This displays a map and gets the first event details from an XML source via AJAX.
An action is made for the AJAX to get the JSON details of the the next event.
In case null is found then it gets the first event again allowing users to cycle thru the events.
